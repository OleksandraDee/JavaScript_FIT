            <h2>About Dublin</h2>
            <p>Dublin, known for its rich history, lively culture, and welcoming atmosphere, becomes especially captivating at night. The cityscape transforms with the glow of lights along the River Liffey, historic buildings illuminated, and a bustling nightlife that brings warmth to the cool Irish evenings.</p>
